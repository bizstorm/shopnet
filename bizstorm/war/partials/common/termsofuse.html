												<h4>Trademarks</h4>



												<p>



													Locoserv Technologies Private Limited is not in a position
													to arbitrate trademark disputes between the advertisers on
													ScantheShops.com and trademark owners. Accordingly, we
													encourage trademark owners to resolve their disputes
													directly with the advertisers, particularly because the
													advertisers may have similar advertisements on other sites.
													Similarly, Locoserv Technologies Private Limited does not
													control and assumes no responsibility for content that
													appears on a third party's website that may be accessed via
													Scantheshops.com or services scantheshops provides to
													Locoserv Technologies Private Limited, and trademark owners
													should contact third-party sites directly to resolve
													trademark disputes. <br> As a courtesy to registered
													trademark owners, however, we are willing to perform a
													limited investigation of reasonable complaints. <br>
													If you are an owner of a registered trademark (or represent
													an owner of a registered trademark) and have an objection
													to content corresponding to your trademark on
													Scantheshops.com that is consistent with the foregoing, or
													if you believe that we have improperly used your registered
													trademark to promote Locoserv Technologies Private Limited
													or Scantheshops.com on a third-party website, please
													provide the following information in a signed letter on
													company stationery: <br> <br> Name of Company<br>
													Contact information (including email address)<br> List
													of registered trademark(s) at issue including a copy of
													each relevant federal trademark registration certificate(s)<br>
													The identity of the advertisement(s) at issue (via the URL
													stated on the bottom line of the ad or other identifying
													information). Please indicate if your complaint is limited
													to specific advertisers/advertisements or if it is a
													general objection to all advertisers.<br> If certain
													affiliates or partners are permitted to use your trademark
													in their ad content, please list the company names in your
													letter.<br> Include the following statement: "I have a
													good faith belief that use of the trademarks described
													above with the advertisements described above are not
													authorized by the trademark owner or its agent, nor is such
													use otherwise permissible under law."<br> Include the
													following statement: "I represent that the information in
													this notification is true and correct and that I am
													authorized to act on behalf of the trademark owner."<br>
													Your signature<br> Please send this written
													communication with the above information to the following
													address:<br> <strong>Locoserv Technologies
														Private Limited Attn: Trademark Agent (Scantheshops.com)
														203, Unitech Arcadia, South City II, Sector - 49, Gurgaon
														- 122018</strong> or<strong> via email to
														hi@Scantheshops.com.</strong> <br> Upon receipt of notice as
													described above, Locoserv Technologies Private Limited will
													confirm the existence of the registration of the trademark
													in question and will take whatever action, in its sole
													discretion, it deems appropriate, which may include the
													removal of the challenged content. In the event that the
													challenged content has been provided to Locoserv
													Technologies Private Limited by a third party and in
													Locoserv Technologies Private Limited's sole discretion, we
													conclude that the content is identical to the registered
													mark and is used in connection with goods and/or services
													covered by the trademark owner's registration, Locoserv
													Technologies Private Limited will provide notice to the
													third party prior to any removal of content. If prior to
													such removal, the third party demonstrates that it has its
													own trademark registration or approved trademark
													application covering the challenged content, Locoserv
													Technologies Private Limited will not remove the content on
													ScanTheShops.com Network. <br> Notwithstanding the
													foregoing, Locoserv Technologies Private Limited will
													comply as appropriate with the terms of any court order
													relating to the behavior of the challenged party identified
													in such court order.
